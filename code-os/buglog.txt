Problem: When included paging, it starts rebooting continously
Symptom: After it automatically reboots, the system reboots again and keeps on looping
Difficulty Finding Bug: hard(4 hrs)
Difficulty Fix: multi-line change
Fix: We figured out that we didn't set the present of b8 index for table entry to 1. Also,
instead of using uint8_t for declaring variables with 1 bit inside the paging structure,
we use uint32_t instead, which fixed the problem.

Problem: After enabling interrupt, we ran into exception vector number 9, coprocessor segment overrun
Symptom: Typing any key on the keyboard results in exception printing vector number 9, coprocessor segment overrun
Difficulty Finding Bug: normal (20mins)
Difficulty Fix: multi-line fix
Fix: the ICW1 is not send to the correct port of the PIC, and the EOI is not send to the correct port on the PIC as well

Problem: Running into exception vector 14, page fault exception
Symptom: Typing keys on the keyboard result in exception printing vector number 14, page fault exception 
Difficulty Finding Bug: 30 mins
Difficulty Fix: multi-line fix
Fix: Set the user_supervisor for page directory entry to 1 and read_write to 1 for user to read and write
 
Problem: IRQ not able to enable 
Symptom: keyboard not responding
Fix: masks all of the IRQ first with 0xFF
Difficulty Finding Bug: easy (10 mins)
Difficulty Fix: easy, one line fix

Problem: Page fault exception when testing file system
Symptom: Test cases not running; screen displays vector number 14, page fault exception 
Difficulty Finding Bug: 30 mins
Difficulty Fix: single-line fix
Fix: I forgot to set the global variable pointer to the file system within the kernel.c file; hence, I was likely accessing
undefined addresses when I used the file system pointer to define my boot block pointer and the entire file system.
The fix was simply to set the file system pointer accordingly to the start of module. 

Problem: Failing read_dentry_by_name tests
Symptom: Failing tests on reading dentry by name for valid file names
Difficulty Finding Bug: 20 mins
Difficulty Fix: multi-line fix
Fix: The issue had to do with the way the test case was written. Instead of checking the return value of call to 
read_dentry_by_name, we also checked the file_name in the dentry struct returned, albeit in the incorrect way without using
strncmp, which was why it never passed the check and hence failed. We modified the test case to print the file name instead, 
which fixed the issue and also confirmed our function was operating correctly.

Problem: Failure to set putc to account for special cases of keyboard characters
Symptom: When backspace and/or tab was pressed, random characters were print on screen, instead of its proper function
Difficulty Finding Bug: 4 hours
Difficulty Fix: multi-line fix
Fix: In lib.c, we failed to modify putc to handle special cases like tab and backspace, which resulted in weird characters
being print on screen. We simply handled the case for tab to print four spaces and backspace to erase from video memory.

Problem: Lack of assembly linkage for rtc
Symptom: After removing our test case using a while loop to call our rtc_handler, the RTC was not interrupting constantly 
at the specified frequency.
Difficulty Finding Bug: 8 hours
Difficulty Fix: multi-line fix
Fix: We were able to fix this issue by adding assembly linkage for the rtc as noted per past discussion.

Problem: Failure to update cursor after clear() screen.
Symptom: Our test case printing results were not starting out at the top left corner of the screen.
Difficulty Finding Bug: 30 mins
Difficulty Fix: multi-line change
Fix: We were able to fix the bug by updating the cursor to be at the top left corner again after calling clear() 
to clear the screen display. 

Problem: Lack of assembly linkage for keyboard
Symptom: Ocassionally run into vector number 14 page fault when typing on keyboard.
Difficulty Finding Bug: 2 hours
Difficulty Fix: multi-line fix
Fix: We were able to fix the bug by adding assembly linkage for the keyboard handler as noted per past discussion.

Problem: Fail to handle backspace in terminal
Symptom: Terminal write prints characters that were previously deleted
Difficulty Finding Bug: 1 hour
Difficulty Fix: multi-line fix
Fix: We were able to fix the bug by deleting the buffer in terminal when backspace is pressed.

Problem: Fail to run terminal_read when enter is pressed
Symptom: When enter is pressed, terminal_read doesn't run
Difficulty Finding Bug: 1 hour
Difficulty Fix: single-line fix
Fix: We were able to fix the bug by declaring the enter stat variable as volatile to allow terminal run to keep reading for changes.

Problem: Fail to read out file data when running tests
Symptom:Nothing is printed
Difficulty Finding Bug: 2 hours
Difficulty Fix: multi-line fix
Fix: We were able to fix it by changing the pointer and the method used to point to the correct data location

Problem: shell not responding no commands
Symptom: shell appears but cannot execute program
Difficulty Finding Bug: 2 hours
Difficulty Fix: multi-line fix
Fix: created global variables for file operation table

Problem: variable set incorrectly
Symptom: linux  penguin is flashing
Difficulty Finding Bug: 15 mins
Difficulty Fix: one-line fix
Fix: the value of ADDRESS_8MB is incorrect is 0x800000 instead of 0x80000

Problem: warnning invlid pointer type
Symptom: warnning when complie
Difficulty Finding Bug: 15 mins
Difficulty Fix: one-line fix
Fix: added int32_t nbytes to rtc_write arg and changed void * buf to const void * buf

Problem: critical section not set up properly
Symptom: wshell no response to commands
Difficulty Finding Bug: 60 mins
Difficulty Fix: one-line fix
Fix: added sti(); in system call read

Problem: system call asm linkage store register incorrectly
Symptom: general protection fault
Difficulty Finding Bug: 45 mins
Difficulty Fix: multi-line fix
Fix: reorder the popl and pushl registers

Problem: read and write not checking correct index in file array 
Symptom: syserr test fail
Difficulty Finding Bug: 45 mins
Difficulty Fix: multi-line fix
Fix: added the filenumber to the array

Problem: did not check empty string in system call open
Symptom: syserr test fail
Difficulty Finding Bug: 45 mins
Difficulty Fix: multi-line fix
Fix: added if condition in system call open

Problem: incorrect algorithm for read data
Symptom: page fault flashing in window
Difficulty Finding Bug: 4 hours
Difficulty Fix: multi-line fix
Fix: had to rewrite the algorithm to find the index in the index node to find block number and increment 
and reset the byte offset when it exceeded the file system block size of 4096 bytes.

/ Checkpoint 4 Bugs /

Problem: Incorrect condition check in terminal write
Symptom: Only the first line from fram0.txt file prints to the screen when we run cat frame0.txt
Difficulty Finding Bug: 2 hours
Difficulty Fix: one-line fix
Fix: We removed the condition check in terminal write that checked if there is a newline character (if there
is a newline character, we return and do not continue writing to terminal, hence why we only print the first line).

Problem: Incorrect page directory index
Symptom: Page fault when we try to cat fish.
Difficulty Finding Bug: 2 hours
Difficulty Fix: one-line fix
Fix: We fixed how we found the page directory index in vidmap to be (128 + 8MB)/4MB.

/ Checkpoint 5 Bugs /
Problem: Linking to incorrect PCB pointer
Symptom: page fault when tring to halt after executing
Difficulty Finding Bug: 4 hours
Difficulty Fix: one-line fix
Fix: We found out that we forgot to link terminal PCB pointer to the newly created PCB pointer after execute therefore it 
would page fault when halting. The error disappeared after we asigned it correctly.

Problem: Not setting the correct index into the keyboard/command buffer
Symptom: Kept printing the outcome of the same command after running different commands
Difficulty Finding Bug: 1.5 hours
Difficulty Fix: one-line fix
Fix: We were not correctly modifying the index into the keyboard/command buffer of the current terminal.

Problem: Did not send_eoi after switching terminal
Symptom: Terminal freezes after switching to itself 
Difficulty Finding Bug: 2 hours
Difficulty Fix: one-line fix
Fix: Add send_eoi after calling terminal switch.

Problem: Cannot read the command when switching terminals
Symptom: When you type "hello" and switch to other terminal and back and press enter, it will show "no such command"
Difficulty Finding Bug: 1.5 hours
Difficulty Fix: one-line fix
Fix: We fixed the bug by deleting a line that modifies the terminal's buffer index
